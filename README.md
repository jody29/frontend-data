## :white_check_mark: Assignment
Create a data visualisation (using the d3 library) based on given data where data can be explored through interaction using enter(), update(), and exit().

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th><strong>1-2</strong></th>
      <th><strong>3-4</strong></th>
      <th><strong>5-6</strong></th>
      <th><strong>7-8</strong></th>
      <th><strong>9-10</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row"><strong>Application</strong> of subject matter</th>
      <td align="center">Git <strong>and d3 are used</strong>; the project runs without errors; <strong>data is loaded with d3</strong>; there is a representation of data</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Data is rendered with d3</strong>; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the data itself</td>
      <td align="center">Data is transformed; the data in the visualization is changed using the d3 update pattern to make an <strong>interactive representation.</strong></td>
      <td align="center">Representation and <strong>use of d3</strong> go beyond an example: there are demonstrable additions like well-chosen interaction methods, animation, multiple chart types, or user input</td>
      <td align="center">üò±<br>The way the student applies subject matter  is more advanced than what they were taught in class; let‚Äôs switch places</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Understanding</th>
      <td align="center">There is substantial own code; the student can explain the code that exists</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code, how everything works together, and why software is used instead of alternatives; the project is structured logically</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; alternatives to software covered in class was used that were great choices</td>
      <td align="center">ü§ì<br>The student deeply understands JavaScript and a geeky / nerdy conversation can be held about this</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Quality</th>
      <td align="center">The project is handed in on time, working, documented, and on GitHub</td>
      <td align="center">Code style is consistent; code and project  are partially documented</td>
      <td align="center">Code adheres to standards; docs cover what the project is and does</td>
      <td align="center">Code quality is good and enforced; docs are useful and professional</td>
      <td align="center">üìö<br>Code and docs both read like great books</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Process</th>
      <td align="center">Process is partially documented</td>
      <td align="center">Process is properly documented</td>
      <td align="center">Choices are evaluated and documented; progress is demonstrated; Work tells a tory</td>
      <td align="center">Significant progress or iterations are demonstrated; Storytelling principles are applied</td>
      <td align="center">üí™<br>What you did this course is amazing; Teachers are in awe of your progress</td>
    </tr>
